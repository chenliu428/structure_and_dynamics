    "Python programs are stored in [PyCode](./PyCode/) and the datasets for training is stored in [DATA/Training_data](./DATA/Training_data/). Training results are saved in [DATA/Results_data](./DATA/Results_data/), as some trainig program lasts quite long and training results are saved for saparated requests, such as comparing, plotting etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inside [PyCode](./PyCode/), programs can be devided into two categories: 1. programs for major tasks, such as training different models or plotting results. 2. programs where are stored functionalities called by major tasking programs. Major task programs could be called in a terminal from the location \"./project/\" to realize various tasks, for example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 ./PyCode/particle_clustering.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the list of programs within each category and a brief description of their use:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Major task category:\n",
    "    1. [particle_clustering.py](./PyCode/particle_clustering.py) - drawing the [propensity map](../README.md#fig1).\n",
    "    2. [GaussianLH_Panelty_RidgeLasso_MAP.py](./PyCode/GaussianLH_Panelty_RidgeLasso_MAP.py) - MAP linear model training and plotting results.\n",
    "    3. [GaussianLH_Panelty_Ridge_Bayes.py](./PyCode/GaussianLH_Panelty_Ridge_Bayes.py) - Bayesian linear model traingin and plotting results.\n",
    "    4. [DeepLearning_MLP.py](./PyCode/DeepLearning_MLP.py) - training multi-layer perpectron (MLP) neron-network, with customered architecture and plotting information about training processes.\n",
    "    5. [Compare_Pearson.py](./PyCode/Compare_Pearson.py) - compare the performance of all trained models, which have their training results filed ready in [DATA/Results_data](./DATA/Results_data/), in terms of the Pearson coeffcient, applied on randomly retrieved traininig dataset.\n",
    "- Functionality Support:\n",
    "    1. [data_read.py](./PyCode/data_read.py) - read and pre-clean the raw data, input /output training results.\n",
    "    2. [data_prep_crossvalid.py](./PyCode/data_prep_crossvalid.py) - prepare data for cross validation i.e. prepare random trials each containing a training set and a validation set.\n",
    "    3. [simpleLinearReg.py](./PyCode/simpleLinearReg.py) - core functionalities for linear regressions.\n",
    "    4. [DeepLearning_Functionalities.py](./PyCode/DeepLearning_Functionalities.py) - as the name suggests.\n",
    "    5. [plot_tools.py](./PyCode/plot_tools.py) - yes, you guess.\n",

No protection mechanism is implemented. File saving instructions usually involvs the function \"save_to_file_a_dictrionary\".\n",

    "Raw dataset are placed in [./DATA/Training_data/](./DATA/Training_data/). We here dispose three datasets that correspond to three different physical conditions. The results exhibited here are only training results from 'Cnf2.xy'. The choice of dataset to train the models can be opted within each program that will be discussed below. \n",
    "\n",
    "In each program, the functionality of loading data from a raw dataset and of cleaning the data to be ready for training, is implemented in [data_read.py](./PyCode/data_read.py). Cleaning the raw data means igonoring input features that vary very little or does not vary from data point to data point. A customer criterion is chosen to drop off a feature, if its data point to data point standared deviation is below that criterion."
