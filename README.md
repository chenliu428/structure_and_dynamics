# Structure and Dynamics in Glasses - a Machine Learning approach 

**Investigation of relevant ones among many types of structure descriptors for determining the mobility of particles in a supercooled liquid** using supervised machine learning techniques.

It showcases also how to gain insighgts of a pratical problem with a data driven approach by combining different machine learning models of different properties.

## Problem Context 
We are dealing with a problem in an active area of current research in statistical physics of glassy materials, such as XXX. A type of material is glassy when the crystallisation (or more generally called the first order transition), such as water becoming ice, is avoided, bypassed or absent with a changing of its environment, usually a dropping temperature. Instead, these materials vitrify, that is they behave like a liquid but becoming more and more viscous with a decreasing temperature until at some point, they apparently stop flowing and stand there like a solid, which we call glasses. This apparent transition from a liquid to a "solid", allegedly call the "glass transition", is unconventional compared to crystallisation where the microscopic structure changes qualitatively from a disordered one of liquids to an ordered structure of crystals, like CFC, CCC, etc. In a glass transition, the microscopic structure is always disordered seemingly unchanged from a liquid, except that molecules have more and more difficulties to move under thermal aggitation, giving rise to its macroscopic drastic increase in viscosity, so large they apperently stop flowing. Physicists havn't come up with a proper explaination of this phenomenon using elementary concepts and hypothesis in physics for more than half a centry, although splended progress has been made. 

Accompanying this dynamical slowing down in a glass transition, molecules move also more and more unevenly over locations and periods (space and time), a phenomenal called "dynamical heterogeneity". It basically states the fact that while particles are active over a period of time, particles at some other places vibrate in place like struggling to get out of their cages, and the fact that while the same particles could be free to move for some period of time, they stuck over some other periods of time.
